<Description>
  Radix Primitives are unstyled—and compatible with any styling
  solution—giving you complete control over styling.
</Description>

## Styling overview

### Functional styles

You are in control of all aspects of styling, including functional styles. For example—by default—a [Dialog Overlay](../components/dialog) won't cover the entire viewport. You're responsible for adding those styles, plus any presentation styles.

### Classes

All components and their parts accept a `className` prop. This class will be passed through to the DOM element. You can use it in CSS as expected.

### Data attributes

When components are stateful, their state will be exposed in a `data-state` attribute. For example, when an [Accordion Item](../components/dialog) is opened, it includes a `data-state="open"` attribute.

## Styling with CSS

### Styling a part

You can style a component part by targeting the `className` that you provide. The primitives can be wrapped to add your class.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
  React.ComponentProps<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>
>((props, forwardedRef) => {
  const { className, ...itemProps } = props;
  return (
    <AccordionPrimitive.Item
      {...itemProps}
      ref={forwardedRef}
      className={'accordion-item ' + className}
    />
  );
});
```

If you would like to retain support for the `as` prop (polymorphism), you can use our `react-polymorphic` types when wrapping.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';
import type * as Polymorphic from '@radix-ui/react-polymorphic';

type AccordionItemComponent = Polymorphic.ForwardRefComponent<
  Polymorphic.IntrinsicElement<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
  Polymorphic.OwnProps<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
>;

const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => {
  const { className, ...itemProps } = props;
  return (
    <AccordionPrimitive.Item
      {...itemProps}
      ref={forwardedRef}
      className={'accordion-item ' + className}
    />
  );
}) as AccordionItemComponent;
```

Alternatively, we expose an `extendPrimitive` utility as a convenience for adding default props while retaining polymoprhism. It can be useful if your preference is to style data attributes as they needn't be composed like class names.

```jsx
import { extendPrimitive } from '@radix-ui/react-primitive';
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const AccordionItem = extendPrimitive(AccordionPrimitive.Item, {
  defaultProps: { 'data-accordion-item': '' },
});

const AccordionPanel = extendPrimitive(AccordionPrimitive.Panel, {
  defaultProps: { 'data-accordion-panel': '' },
});
```

```css
[data-accordion-item] {
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

[data-accordion-panel] {
  padding: 10px;
}
```

### Styling a state

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```css
.accordion-item {
  border-bottom: 1px solid gainsboro;
}

.accordion-item[data-state='open'] {
  border-bottom-width: 2px;
}
```

## Styling with CSS-in-JS

The examples below are using [Stitches](https://stitches.dev), but you can use any CSS-in-JS library of your choice.

### Styling a part

You can style a component part by wrapping it in a `styled` function (or equivalent).

```jsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',
});

const StyledPanel = styled(Accordion.Panel, {
  padding: 10,
});
```

### Styling a state

You can style a component state by targeting its `data-state` attribute.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item, {
  borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',

  '&[data-state=open]': {
    borderBottomWidth: '2px',
  },
});
```

### Demo

Here's an example of how you can style the [Accordion](../components/accordion) component with CSS-in-JS.

```jsx
import { styled } from '@stitches/react';
import * as Accordion from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';

const StyledAccordion = styled(Accordion.Root, {});
const StyledItem = styled(Accordion.Item, {});
const StyledHeader = styled(Accordion.Header, {});
const StyledTrigger = styled(Accordion.Trigger, {});
const StyledPanel = styled(Accordion.Content, {});

export default () => {
  return (
    <StyledAccordion type="single">
      <StyledItem value="item-1">
        <StyledHeader>
          <StyledTrigger>Trigger text</StyledTrigger>
        </StyledHeader>
        <StyledPanel>Panel content</StyledPanel>
      </StyledItem>
    </StyledAccordion>
  );
};
```

## Summary

Radix Primitives were designed to encapsulate accessibility concerns and other complex functionalities, while ensuring you retain complete control over styling.

For convenience, stateful components include a `data-state` attribute.
